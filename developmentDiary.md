# Regex and linescraping
I was pondering to replace regex with my own scraper. But I got convinced that it would be bad idea, and regex is good for for that.
But in the spirit of improving this software I simplified regex string and added better reading for different formats. Last time, my regex could only handle <number>\s<chars> now it can handle x and or , after number. And the name may contain special characters.

# GUI
The short term plan is to implement two panel system to my GUI. Right panel would list cards etc, and left panel would serve as place for graphs or card images. Today evening I implemented the panels and left one got working with out a hitch.

# TODO
I also implented the method for my deckdata. So assume that I will/can implement different (Mana curve etc) graphs tomorrow.
