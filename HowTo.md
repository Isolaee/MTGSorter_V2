<summary>Future?</summary>
There are two concrete updates that I want to do.
1. Get the ML part working in software.
2. While you have active deck, seeing the card image from request. (Done 19/04)

Of course I would like to implement more data tools, but I feel like having that ML integration was big part why I rewrote the software and seeing deck images is very important since that image contains almoust all of the data you need, from a single card. It would make thinking about your deck as a user, much easier.

But this project is not yet done, so I will have time to make proper changes.
